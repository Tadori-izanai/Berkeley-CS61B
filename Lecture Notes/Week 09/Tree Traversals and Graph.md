# Tree and Graph Traversals

## Tree Definition (Review)

Tree
* A set of nodes (or vertices).
* A set of edges that connect those nodes.
* There is exactly one path between any two nodes.

Rooted tree
* The tree has a designated root.
* Every node except the root has exactly one parent.
* A node can have 0 or more children.

## Trees Traversal

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.

### Level Order Traversal

Iterate the tree by levels, from left to right.
* First level: D
* Second level: B F
* Third leve: A C E G

```
D B F A C E G
```

### Depth-First traversal

#### Pre-order Traversal

* Visit root node.
* Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
* Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.

```java
public void preOrder(BSTNode x) {
    if (x == null) return;
    print(x.key)
    preOrder(x.left)
    preOrder(x.right)
}
```

```
D B A C F E G
```

#### In-order Traversal

* Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
* Visit the root node.
* Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.

```java
public void inOrder(BSTNode x) {
    if (x == null) return;    
    inOrder(x.left)
    print(x.key)
    inOrder(x.right)
}
```

```
A B C D E F G
```

#### Post-order Traversal

* Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
* Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.
* Visit the root node.

```java
public void postOrder(BSTNode x) {
    if (x == null) return;    
    postOrder(x.left)
    postOrder(x.right)
    print(x.key)   
}
```

```
A C B E G F D
```

A useful visual Trick

## Graphs Definition

### Graph
* A set of nodes (or vertices).
* A set of zero of more edges, each of which connects two nodes.
* All trees are also graphs, but not all graphs are trees.

### Simple Graphs and Multigraphs
* Only one edge between each of two nodes.
* No edge from a node to itself.
* The course will only focus on simple graphs.

### Undirected and Directed Graphs
* Undirected graphs contain bidirectional edges.
* Directed graphs contain directed edges.

### Acyclic and Cyclic Graphs
* Cyclic graphs contain at least one graph cycle.
* Acyclic graphs do not have graph cycles. (can either be a tree or not)

### More Definitions
* Verticies with an edge between are adjacent.
* Vertices or edges may have lables or weights.
* A sequence of vertices connectted by edges is a path.
* A path of which first and last verticies are the same is a cycle.
* Two vertices are connected when there is a path between them.
* If all vertices are connected, the graph is connected.

## Graph Problems

### s-t Path

Find whether there's a path between vertices s and t.

<img src="./Tree Traversals and Graph.assets/image-20230301150422807.png" alt="image-20230301150422807" style="zoom:25%;" />

To solve this problem, an algorithm similar to the tree traversal is created. 

```pseudocode
public boolean connected(s, t)

mark s

if (s == t):
    return true;

for child in unmarked_neighbors(s):
    if connected(child, t):
        return true;

return false;
```

The algorithm marks the verticies it has already visited to avoid infinite loop.

### DFS (Depth First Search)

This algorithm of exploring a neighborâ€™s entire subgraph before moving on to the next neighbor is known as Depth First Traversal.

This kind of traversal could help us to find a path from s to every other reachable vertex, visiting each vertex at most once.

To implement this traversal algorithm, two arrays, `marked` and `edgeTo`, are required to record whether an vertex is marked and the parent of the vertex. 

* Mark v.
* For each unmarked adjancent vertex w:
* * Set `edgeTo[w] = v`.
* * Run these steps for w.

### Graph Traversals

* DFS Preorder: Action is before DFS calls to neighbors. (The algorithm created above.)
    - the action is setting `edgeTo`
* DFS Postorder: Action is after DFS calls to neighbors.
    * `mark(s)`
    * for each unmarked nieghbor n in s: dfs(n)
    * print(s)
* BFS (Breadth First Search) Order: Act in order of distance from s. (Analogous to "level order.")

cheat sheet

1. bfs

    ```pseudocode
    bfs(s):			/* suppose s is the starter node, the same below */
    	initialize an empty queue
    	queue.enequeue(s)
    	mark s
    	while queue is not empty:
            v = queue.dequeue()
    		visit v
    		for each unmarked neighbor of v:
    			queue.endeuqe(neighbor)
    			mark neighbor
    ```

2. dfs preorder (non-recursive)
    ```pseudocode
    dfs_preorder(s):
    	initialize an empty stack
    	stack.push(s)
    	while stack is not empty:
            v = stack.pop()
            if v is unmarked:
                mark v
                visit v
                for each unmarked neighbor of v:
                    stack.push(neighbor)	/* in reverse order */
    ```

3. dfs postorder (non-recursive)

    ```pseudocode
    dfs_postorder(s):
    	initialize an empty stack
    	stack.push(s)
    	while stack is not empty:
    		v = stack.peek()
    		if v has no unmarked neighbors:
    			stack.pop()
    			visit v		/* if v has been processed, ignore this */
            else:
            	for each unmarked neighbor of v:
            		stack.push(neighbor)	/* in reverse order */
            mark v
    ```
